The Evanosky Foundation’s first project was the (file: duke-laptop-project.pdf text: donation of 19 laptops and a color laser printer to the Duke University Children’s Hospital in the fall of 2006).  Since then, The Evanosky Foundation has come forward as a strong player in research and family support for children and families battling MLD as well as other lysosomal storage disorders.  We are active on a number of fronts including:

* focusing on early detection of MLD through (link: projects/newborn-screening text: newborn screening)
* (link: projects/medical-research text: finding a cure for MLD through medical research)
* donating books, movies, computers and audio/visual equipment to children’s hospitals through (link: projects/family-support/jacks-library text: Jack’s Library)
* (link: projects/family-support text: providing financial support, adaptive equipment and temporary medical housing to families affected by MLD)

We have published our 2007-2010 Annual Reports and they can be viewed by clicking (link: news-events#annual-reports text: here).  The purpose of providing this strategic plan is to give you, our supporters, an understanding of where we have been and where we are going as we move towards making this place a little better than we found it.

As you read through our (link: projects/medical-research text: goals), I ask that you to continue to support our cause.  We have been able to accomplish a lot in a very short time as a result of your efforts.  We vow to be faithful stewards of all monies raised, and promise to respect individual donors’ requests pertaining to use of their funds.  In addition, the minimal overhead cost that exists to operate the Foundation is paid for by the Evanosky family.  If you would like to make a 100%, tax deductible donation, please (link: donate text: click here).

Our goal is to leave no child behind as we move forward with our (link: projects/medical-research text: research) and family support initiatives.
