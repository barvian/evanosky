On March 9, 2010, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson made New Mexico the third state in the U.S. to screen all babies for five lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) -- Fabry, Gaucher, Krabbe, Pompe, and Niemann-Pick diseases -- all of which are similar to metachromatic leukodystrophy.  The Evanosky Foundation worked closely with Julie Allen (pictured far right - the grandmother of a child with MLD - with Bob Evanosky and Gov. Richardson), along with two other advocates and (link: http://www.nmlegis.gov/lcs/legislator_details_archive.aspx?SponsorCode=HKINR text: Rep. Rhonda S. King), to pass this important legislation.  The implementation of this law will allow approximately 28,000 babies each year to be screened for these diseases, which is especially beneficial for New Mexico since it has the highest incidence of Niemann-Pick C disease in the country.
