The Evanosky Foundation has also formed The John, Christopher, and Jack Evanosky MLD Treatment Fund at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC.  The fund will be used solely to provide financial assistance to families with children diagnosed the metachromatic leukodystrophy who are seeking treatment from Dr. Maria Escolar, a recognized expert in MLD.  The fund, which is currently valued at $10,000, will be a "last resort" source of funding when all other forms of financial support have been exhausted or denied.  The money may be used for travel and lodging expenses, medical evaluations and testing, parking fees, or other items that will help MLD families receive care and treatment from Dr. Escolar.  More information about Dr. Escolar and the Program for the Study of Neurodevelopment in Rare Disorders program can be found on the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC's (link: http://www.chp.edu/CHP/neurodevelopment+in+rare+disorders text: website).
