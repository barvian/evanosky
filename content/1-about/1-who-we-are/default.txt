The Evanosky Foundation was formed in 2005 by close friends of Bob and Sonya Evanosky after John, Christopher, and Jack Evanosky were diagnosed with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD).  The foundationâ€™s goal is to generate money to fund research toward curing pediatric leukodystrophies, establish universal newborn screening, as well as to provide support and care for children and families affected by one of the leukodystrophies, lysosomal storage disorders, or other disabling pediatric conditions.
