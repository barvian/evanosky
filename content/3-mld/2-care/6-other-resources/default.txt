## Articles

Many times it is very difficult for families with special needs to integrate with a church and receive the necessary spiritual support that they desperately need.  Please click (link: http://www.evanoskyfoundation.org/PDF%20Articles/FaithIEPFull.pdf text: here) to read an excellent article that appeared in the July 2008 issue of *Exceptional Parent* that discusses how you can work with people in your church to create a "spiritual IEP"!

In the May 2008 edition of *Working Mother*, an article entitled *The Quiet Struggle* states "The number of working moms raising kids who have special needs is eye-opening.  Nearly a quarter of a million children under age 3 have a developmental delay and difficulty moving their arms or legs or both, according to recent U.S. Census figures.  More than 400,000 children who are 3 to 5 years old have a developmental delay and are challenged when walking, running or playing.  And among those ages 6 to 24, more than eight million have a disability.  All told, about 9 percent of employees care for a child with a disability."

## Travel

Traveling with a child with MLD can be very difficult.  We have found that using a van with a wheelchair lift or at least reclining seats is most effective.

If you do have the opportunity to travel with your child, you may want to consider Disneyworld in Orlando, Florida.  We have taken our children there several times (even while one was on a ventilator) and it has been a tremendous experience.  The park is well set up for people with disabilities and employees are trained on how to interact with the children.  Special parade viewing areas are set up for people with disabilities, and the characters regularly stopped by so that each of my children could see the characters.  Here are some excellent resources for planning your stay at Disneyworld:
