Graft vs. host disease (GVHD) can occur after a stem cell transplant and is a result of the "new" or graft cells attacking the body's existing cells.  Symptoms of GVHD include itching, rash, vomiting and diarrhea.  If left untreated, GVHD will eventually attack the body's organs and can cause death.
