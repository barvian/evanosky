Title: Treatment

Text: 

**Currently, the only form of treatment for a person diagnosed with MLD is a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, and these are typically only performed on people who do not display any significant symptoms of MLD**. Gene therapy research is ongoing, but less-toxic transplants are currently showing the most promise. For more information on MLD research efforts, please click here.

Various hospitals in the country currently perform bone marrow and stem cell transplants.  Duke University is a leader in performing stem cell transplants in children with MLD, while University of Minnesota has performed many bone marrow transplants for MLD patients. Click here for a slide show of Jack Evanosky's stem cell transplant journey.

The advantage that stem cell transplants have over bone marrow transplants is that stem cells do not have to match as closely as bone marrow, and therefore are much easier to obtain.  In addition, doctors have found that patients who receive stem cell transplants seem to show more improvement than patients who receive bone marrow transplants.

## Who should I contact for more information?

If you know of a child or loved one who was recently diagnosed with MLD and are looking for information regarding umbilical cord stem cell transplants, please contact Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg at Duke University by e-mail at kurtz001@mc.duke.edu.

## Published research on transplant effectiveness for leukodystrophies 

* Click here to read a paper on the effectiveness of umbilical cord stem cell transplants for children with inherited metabolic disorders such as MLD.
* Transplant Outcomes in Leukodystophies was published in January 2010 and authored by Paul Orchard and Jakub Tolar.  It discusses the effectiveness of stem cell transplants for Krabbe disease, ALD, and MLD at various points of disease progression.
