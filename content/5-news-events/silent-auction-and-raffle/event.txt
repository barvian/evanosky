Thank you to everyone who helped, donated to, or attended the Foundation's first silent auction on August 4, 2006.  This event raised over $30,000 to help support research to find a cure for MLD!

All monies raised from the Silent Auction will go towards the Duke Pediatric BMT Research Fund which will support Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg's research at Duke University.  These monies will be used to progress research in cell replacement therapy for MLD (metachromatic leukodystrophy) and Krabbe Disease (another leukodystrophy).

**Thank you to everyone who purchased tickets!**
