## What will my donation be used for?

Your donation will be used to support:

* **(link: projects/medical-research text: Medical Research)** -- We are currently supporting research at Duke University to find a cure for MLD.  Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg is leading research that has the potential to stop the progression of MLD and other diseases, and we are hoping that human safety trials can begin soon.
* **(link: projects/newborn-screening text: Newborn screening)** -- Because children are often diagnosed too late for any treatment to be effective, The Evanosky Foundation is working to test for these fatal diseases at birth so children can receive treatment.  Within Illinois, the Foundation worked with Senator Dale Righter to pass SB1566, which expands newborn screening to include five diseases that are similar to MLD.
* **(link: projects/family-support text: Family support)** -- Families that are battling against a leukodystrophy are often under significant financial and time pressures because of their childâ€™s disability.  Also, if a child is a candidate to receive a stem cell transplant, the family will often have to move, maintain a residence near the medical facility, and miss work.  For these cases, The Evanosky Foundation provides funds and medical equipment to help these families.
