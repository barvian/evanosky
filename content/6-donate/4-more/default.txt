Title: More ways to help

Text: 

There are several ways you can help The Evanosky Foundation achieve its goals and fight MLD:

1. **Hold a Fundraiser** - You can "do your own" fundraiser to benefit The Evanosky Foundation.  Some people have garage sales, some people make and sell jewelry, and others have walk-a-thons or poker tournaments.  Any type of fundraiser you have, from small to large, is helpful, and we can help promote your event on our website and trhough our e-mail database.
2. **Run or Walk in a Marathon or Half-Marathon** - In 2009, The Evanosky Foundation officially participated in the (link: http://www.chicagomarathon.com/ text: Bank of America Chicago Marathon) in October and the (link: http://www.rnrchicago.com/ text: Chicago Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon) in August.  You can run the marathon or do a walk/run for the half marathon and raise money by getting sponsors and donations.  If you don't live in the Chicago area, you can compete in an event near you.  We've had people run other marathons in California or other places and raise money competing in those events.  The Evanosky Foundation can provide you with sample e-mails and letters that you can send to potential supports and we can also provide additional support.

3. **Coordinate a Book Drive** - The Evanosky Foundation provides books to children who are undergoing transplants for metabolic disorders (like MLD), leukemia, or other cancers through its Jack's Library program at Duke University Children's Hospital in North Carolina as wel as Children's Hospital in Chicago.  Since these children are very susceptible to germs and infections during treatment, and something as simple as a common cold can become life threatening, the books provided are **brand new**.  Books are not shared, but each child is given a book to keep.  (link: projects/family-support/jacks-library text: For more information on Jack's Library, please click here).
