  What if The Evanosky Foundation earned a penny every time you searched the Internet?  Well, now we can!
  
  GoodSearch.com is a new search engine that donates half its revenue, about a penny per search, to the charities its users designate.  You use it just as you would any search engine, and it’s powered by Yahoo!, so you get great results.
  
  Just go to (link: http://goodsearch.com text: www.goodsearch.com) and be sure to enter Evanosky Foundation as the charity you want to support.  Just 500 of us searching four times a day will raise about $7,300 in a year without anyone spending a dime!  And, be sure to spread the word!
2. ### Shop through iGive
